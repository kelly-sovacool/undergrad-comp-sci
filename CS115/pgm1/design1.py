#1. Display 'Runway Calculations' and the logo
#2. Prompt the user to enter a velocity (in kilometers per hour)
#3. Prompt the user to enter an acceleration (in meters per second squared)
#4. Create a variable to hold the kilometers to meters conversion factor
#5. Create a variable to hold the hours to seconds conversion factor
#6. Convert the velocity from kilometers per hour to meters per second
#7. Calculate the required length of the runway (in meters)
#8. Create a variable to hold the meters to feet conversion factor
#8. Convert the required runway length from meters to feet
#10. Display the required runway length in both meters and feet
